# bunch-linux-metalayer
Bunch linux is a project created for learning purposes. The idea is to fully understand the foundations of systems and applications starting from the lowest possible level. 


Notes:
To develop using qtcreator directly looks needed to add inherit populate_sdk_qt5 into the image and TOOL_SDK:append " qtbase qt declarative" into the local.conf
